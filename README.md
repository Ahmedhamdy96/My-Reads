# MyReads Project

Udacity React project in which I have created a books app that allows user to select and categorize books to three different categories ( currently reading , want to read and read ).
The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

### Getting Started

- Clone project repository with `git clone https://github.com/Ahmedhamdy96/My-Reads-`
- Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the development server with `npm start`
